# Copilot Instructions — Stream Deck Cloudflare Utilities

## Template Collaboration

This plugin participates in the **stream-deck-template** knowledge-sharing ecosystem:
https://github.com/pedrofuentes/stream-deck-template

The template repo collects learnings from all Stream Deck plugins. This plugin's
contribution tracking file lives at `contributions/cloudflare-utilities.md` in that repo.

### Before Starting Major Work

Read the template's `LEARNINGS.md` for the latest consolidated knowledge from all plugins.
It contains hard-won solutions for SVG rendering, manifest quirks, PI patterns, polling,
testing, and more — discovered across multiple plugin projects.

Fetch it directly:
```

```

Also check the companion guides for testing and UI:
```

https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pedrofuentes/stream-deck-template/main/scaffold/.github/UI-DESIGN-GUIDE.md
```

### After Significant Work — Contribute Back

After completing significant work (new features, bug fixes, workarounds, testing discoveries),
**proactively offer to write new learnings back to the template repo**.

See `AGENTS.md` for the full contribution protocol.

### Pre-Release Gate — MANDATORY

**Never tag, push, or create a release without the user testing on their physical Stream Deck
first.** The Stream Deck CLI (`validate`, `restart`) only checks manifest schema and plugin
loading — it cannot verify runtime behavior, UI rendering, or key display. Always ask the
user to test on device and wait for explicit confirmation before releasing.

## Project Rules

Refer to `AGENTS.md` for the full set of project rules, architecture, testing requirements,
and conventions.
