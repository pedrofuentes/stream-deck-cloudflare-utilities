# Copilot Instructions — Stream Deck Cloudflare Utilities

## Template Origin & Knowledge Sharing

This plugin was created from the **stream-deck-template**: https://github.com/pedrofuentes/stream-deck-template

The template repo collects learnings from all Stream Deck plugins. This plugin's contributions live at `S:\Pedro\Projects\stream-deck-template\contributions\cloudflare-utilities.md`.

**Before starting major work**, read `S:\Pedro\Projects\stream-deck-template\LEARNINGS.md` for the latest consolidated knowledge from all plugins. This contains hard-won solutions for SVG rendering, manifest quirks, PI patterns, polling, testing, and more — discovered across multiple plugin projects.

**After significant work**, proactively offer to write new learnings back to the template. See the "Contributing Learnings Back to the Template" section in `AGENTS.md` for details.

## Project Rules

Refer to `AGENTS.md` for the full set of project rules, architecture, testing requirements, and conventions.

## Pre-Release Gate — MANDATORY

**Never tag, push, or create a release without the user testing on their physical Stream Deck first.** The Stream Deck CLI (`validate`, `restart`) only checks manifest schema and plugin loading — it cannot verify runtime behavior, UI rendering, or key display. See `AGENTS.md` section "5. Pre-Release Checklist" for the full required workflow. Always ask the user to test on device and wait for explicit confirmation before releasing.
